# About this package

This is a set of functions I end up recreating every time I use localStorage for anything, so I've published them in this package. Mostly for my own use, but if anyone else finds them handy that's just great.

## How does it work

The main setting and getting functions take a single object and a key and stores it in an array that can be expanded or deleted from as required. When it retrieves something from storage it converts to a JSON object array.

### Disclaimer

Apologies for the poor documentation. I'm currently busy with lessons and as mentioned before this is mainly intended for my own use. If you use this package and would like me to document it more thoroughly I'll try to prioritise it, otherwise that's a task for when I have more free time to do so.
